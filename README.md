# Feed Court

I dearly loved the wall of text aggregator [Popurls](http://web.archive.org/web/20151031011257/http://popurls.com/), until they started messing with it, forcing in images and dropping customization. It didn't seem to hard to create a clone of my own, so that's what this project is: a dead simple server-side web app that grabs RSS feeds and puts them on a page. 

The index.html is generated by a cron'd python script that reads a list of rss feeds. Vanilla javascript creates an event to expand div to see more text. That's about it for now. 

## Active Demo

[http://feedcourt.bendonnelly.com/](http://feedcourt.bendonnelly.com/)

## Requires
[Python feedparser](http://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/introduction.html)

## Included OMPL2TXT converter
1) Download the OPML files you want from the repo: https://github.com/plenaryapp/awesome-rss-feeds
   
### Convert a single OPML file
2) Run the opml2txt.py file
   
```python3 opml_to_feedlist.py recommended.opml```

### Convert multiple OPML files into one feedlist
3) Convert files
   
```python3 opml_to_feedlist.py tech.opml news.opml linux.opml my_feeds.txt```

### Convert all OPML files in a directory
  
```python3 opml_to_feedlist.py *.opml combined_feeds.txt```

4) Copy to rssfeedz:   

```
cp feedlist.txt ~/rssfeedz/feedlist.txt
cd ~/rssfeedz
python3 parsefeeds.py
```

The script automatically:

✓ Removes duplicate feeds

✓ Adds helpful comments with feed titles

✓ Organizes by source file

✓ Handles multiple files at once
